# Feature Engineering
> [!NOTE]
> This is an Evolutionary algorithm aplication, more specifically an aplicaction of a Genetic Algorithm for feature selection in a Decision Tree model

For the base of this excercise, we'll use the following [Kaggle Job Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murilozangari/jobs-and-salaries-in-data-field-2024?resource=download) from 2024 [Jobs and Salaries in Data Science](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data/data) 

we'll use the following variables as the base for the decision tree as to have a plotabvle and manageable result that we can easlily analize
