Donald could hold and score 5 points but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2 and could hold with a turn total of 7 points but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1 and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.*\"\n","\n","our goal this time is to find what is the probability of getting a partial sum in a single turn without exceeding the objective, in other words from the minimum sum (in the base case 2) to the objective or winning condition (in the base case 100).\n","\n","We know that the probability of any face to appear in a 6-sided dice is $1/6$ or $\\approx 16.67\\%$ or in other words the probability of getting any number from an array from 1 to 6 with a uniform distribution.\n","\n","We'll divide the results into Probability to Lose ***(PL)***, which in the base case will mean to get a 1 in any of the \"steps\" (*any dice thrown during a turn*) of the player's turn, and Probability to Win ***(PW)*** which will mean the probability to get to a specific sum in a single turn.\n","\n","To ease our process, we'll only calculate the ***PL*** and found the ***PW*** as $PW = 1 - PL$.\n","\n","Our first instinct would be to check for the probabilities of $N$ number of throws, finding those ***PL*** we can go step by step in probability tree diagram.\n","\n","Starting with the first 3 throws we get the following probabilities trees:\n","\n","If we do 1 throw, we'll have a $PL = 1/6 \\approx 16.67 \\%$ making the $PW = 5/6 \\approx 83.33 \\%$\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12g0RigIh4VdCe4IZE1aBnFaht2vox_aU)\n","\n","\n","If we do 2 throws, we'll have a $PL = (1/6) + [(1/6) * (5/6)] \\approx 30.56 \\%$ making the $PW = (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36 \\approx 69.44 \\%$\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12g4HFqcZT2BQnvE3d3uYBeVJMQL0rXBM)\n","\n","\n","If we do 3 throws, we'll have a $PL = (1/6) + [(1/6) * (5/6)] + [(1/6) * (5/6) * (5/6)]  \\approx 42.13 \\%$ making the $PW = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = 125/216 \\approx 57.87 \\%$\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12gCMB5TiEKeEf6CEGUJWNCuJStEVbi-8)\n","\n","If see a pattern emerging where the ***PW*** is equal to (5/6)$ to the power of the number of throws so for 3 throws we'll get $PW = (5/6)^3 \\approx 57.87\\%$ or ina more generilized form $PW = ((Faces - FacesToLose)/Faces)^N$ where $Faces$ is the array , $FacesToLose$ is the array of 'faces' in which the player will lose the amount summed in the current turn.\n","\n","But this approach is only giving us the probability of losing and winning if we threw the dice consecutively, not the probability of getting to an objective sum in a single turn, for example if we want to get to a sum of 3 in a single turn we may have to throw the dice 2 times if the outcome of the first throw is a 2 but in the second throw any number besides the 1 will get us to the objective and we'll end the turn there.\n","\n","So to get the true ***PL*** we'll have to go on a probability tree step by step, for this we'll define ***DN*** as the possible dice result of the $N_{th}$ throw that needed to be done to get to the objective sum, and ***RN*** as the result of the $N_{th}$ throw, but we'll only count the amount of paths that will end in a loss.\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12g_qIwUW4Q4TJT2JqwLZFhYfGOn9DWRF)\n","\n","As an example we just look at the objective of 3, if we throw the dice once we have 6 possible outcomes (any of the possible faces) but since we only care about how many times we'll lose then we have 3 different possibilities, we get a **1** and we lose in the firs throw, we get a 2 and we have to do a second throw since this puts the turn sum less than the objective sum, and finally a **4/6** possibility of landing a **3** or more which will make the turn sum greater or equal to the objective sum which should end our turn since we either win and/or achieved the turn objective.\n","\n","If we look at the probabilities of each of the scenarios of happening, we have the following:\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12jBiiWbHER8J-sewEk59XrvV1bkxmN49)\n","\n","If we sum the probabilities of falling while trying to get a **3** as an objective sum, we have $PL = (1/6) + [(1/6) * (1/6)] = (1/6) + (1/6)^{2} ≈ 16.67 \\% + 2.78 \\% ≈ 19.44 \\%$ which makes the $PW = 1 - PL ≈ 1 - 19.44 \\% ≈ 80.56 \\%$\n","\n","we start to see a pattern, but to be sure let's look at the probability trees from objectives 4 through 7.\n","\n","**Objetive Sum = 4**\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12gf0S6P35LP1Pp-jsWQqO-DNeclMe9Cr)\n","\n","$PL = (1/6) + [2 * (1/6)^{2}] ≈ 22.23 \\%$\n","\n","**Objetive Sum = 5**\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12hNNt8yeWNZ5V_jAph7o5NNIOjE37LAA)\n","\n","$PL = (1/6) + [3 * (1/6)^{2}] + [1 * (1/6)^{3}] ≈ 25.46 \\%$\n","\n","**Objetive Sum = 6**\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12hO6mGmPAlrLS2MSqMmKo-S9UmQYGOp7)\n","\n","$PL = (1/6) + [4 * (1/6)^{2}] + [3 * (1/6)^{3}] ≈ 29.17 \\%$\n","\n","**Objetive Sum = 7**\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12iP54PS2BjIT_izrBIy7p7dBpA8mE1Y9)\n","\n","$PL = (1/6) + [5 * (1/6)^{2}] + [6 * (1/6)^{3}] + [1 * (1/6)^{4}] ≈ 33.41 \\%$\n","\n","As we can see the ***PL*** could be generalized as the following equation\n","\n","$$\n","PL =  \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [(Faces - FacesToLose)^{i-1} * ( \\frac{FacesToLose}{Faces})^{i}]\n","$$\n","\n","But this will only get us to the first issue of using **N** as the number of consecutive throws and not give us the ***PL** of the case when we reach the objective we finish the turn, for that we can use the generalized equation but changing the $(Faces - FacesToLose)^{i-1}$ part for an exact number of times a ***DN*** is reached.\n","\n","For an example we can see a handmade table of the first **10** objective sums for the base case game:\n","\n","![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12krAn6PFEx_vpoOrXPoRpDdM3JUae3U-)\n","\n","So, we can use the number of times an objective sum may get us to throw ***N*** number of dices, for example if we want to check the ***PL*** of objective sum **9** then we'll have:\n","\n","$$\n","PL = [1*(1/6)^{1}] + [5*(1/6)^{2}] + [15*(1/6)^{3}] + [10*(1/6)^{4}] + [1*(1/6)^{5}] ≈ 38.28 \\%\n","$$\n","\n","then for us to get these number of possible throws we'll tackle it with a recursive function that's go through all the possible tree branches and sum their probabilities of happening to get the ***PL***"],"metadata":{"id":"H3EZPFEaJjhS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Code\n","\n","We start by importing the libraries we'll use for the
