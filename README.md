# Portfolio

Hi I'm **Juan David Gallego** a M.Sc. Data Scientist with experiences in the business and finance world, here's a quick portfolio of some projects to show case my work. 

## Contents
- [Dice Roll (Reinforced Learning)](https://github.com/Kassoomy/Portfolio/tree/main/Dice%20Roll%20(Reinforced%20Learning)): an application of reinforced learning to a simple game of dice, where the objective of the model is to learn the optimal strategy, which we know theoretically beforehand; it's also a good example for explaining and playing around with the different component of a general reinforced learning algorithm.

-  [Feature Engineering (GA)](https://github.com/Kassoomy/Portfolio/tree/main/Feature%20Engineering%20(GA)): Another approach to the feature selection problem when training models, in this case we use a **Genetic Algorithm** to find the optimal set of features in a decision tree case.

-  [GoGetEm (Excel Game)](https://github.com/Kassoomy/Portfolio/tree/main/GoGetEm%20(Excel%20Game)): A simple game of catch for local multiplayer based on Excel macros.

-  [Pig (Dice Game)](https://github.com/Kassoomy/Portfolio/tree/main/Pig%20(Dice%20Game)): A recursive programming approach to find the probabilities of getting a sum in a single turn in a game of Pig.

-  [Stock Price Prediction (BERT)](https://github.com/Kassoomy/Portfolio/tree/main/Stock%20Price%20Prediction%20(BERT)): An approach to predict the movement of an stock based on the news using BERT.

-  [Superpermutation Method](https://github.com/Kassoomy/Portfolio/tree/main/Superpermutation%20Method): an approach for tackling the superpermutation problem, made in conjunction with [Spjmu](https://github.com/spjmu)
